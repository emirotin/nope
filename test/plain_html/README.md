This sammple uses single HTML file representing the trivial chat screen.

To run the Nope server do
    sudo node src/nope.js
Sudo is recommended by socket.io.

Due to socket.io resctriction for some browsers it's recommended to serve the file under HTTP server - in this case run
    python serve.py
and open http://localhost:8000/index.html
